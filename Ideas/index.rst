One of the things that I liked about `Japan Summons`_ is the fact that, while overpowered and unapologetically broken, they somewhat have to deal with supply constraints, modern trading partners not existing, Japan being very anti-nuke, the different ways of doing diplomacy, as well as having their hands tied behind their backs by the size and philosophy of their military. I want to keep that same idea going, with powerful, out-of-this-world weapons that aren't unlimited and aren't going to blanket the globe.

After playing a bunch of Titanfall, I really liked the aesthetic. In terms of cool visual stuff, it really left an impression. I didn't want to bring the Titan part of it in, as that kind of...overpowers everything, but the movement, weapons, and machines are immensely cool and I think some cool stories could be told about them.

It also gives a nice way to say that they're already resource limited (not self-sufficient) without having to break the immersion of a space-faring society. Sure, manufacturing exists, but it'll need to be heavily expanded, and food is a huge source of trouble post-move because of their planet and reliance on supply ships.

I also wanted to kind of remove the absolute domination that any one nation gets to have. Some may be might be technologically advanced, but weapons still require tactics, preparation and development. Also, most of the main countries are going to be within a couple decades of each other in terms of development. Some will be early interwar (1920s/30s), the GVE will be WWII (1940s), and the 'uncivilized' parts will be something just before the interwar period. This should make things *slight* more sane, instead of having a tech tree spanning like 1000 years just from non-transported nations. This should make it more believable that they have dialogues and diplomatic meetings between say Mu and Parpaldia.

The population should be enough to be a large city, but not enough to take over a planet, especially not one the size of the Japan Summons' planet. I think half a million people makes sense to give the frontier a real sense of "this is a place people live" but not "this is a major metropolis." It'll be futuristic, but not overbearing.

This isn't really going to be a full-on military fan-fiction, but it is going to have some military bits, so this next bit is somewhat important.

One of the main things are Simulacra: human brains transferred into machines. In TF they are somewhat broken, but after decades of advancement they can finally not shut down while thinking about themselves. Useful for research as they're much more durable than a human, they are still limited in their power. Only able to operate for a month or so away from power, they need a lot of infrastructure for maintenance, and many of them don't look that human since they don't have faces. Some look like Ash in Titanfall, but that's relatively rare.

Visuals
-------

Blue glowing things, harvesters, *MASSIVE* structures, underground tunnel networks below the structures. All of these are kind of used from TF and Apex, with some others are taken from a book series I read not too long ago, *Frontlines* by Marko Kloos. He details some very cool civilization stuff in there, specifically the colony base that the main character gets sequestered on in the early books.
