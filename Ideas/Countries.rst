Countries
=========

While the military is going to be needed because we're literally dealing with insane people that still use gunboat diplomacy as a norm, it's not all going to be that. The :ref:`United Systems` limits things a lot, unlike the Corpos. Corpos are going to be mentioned, but I don't think they'll ever actually appear, so just think of the worst you could imagine when it comes to planetary exploitation: resource depletion, basically slaves and brutal, dangerous efficiency. Directly the enemy of the U.S., they are the reason for any military presence on the frontier.

Resources
---------

Mostly the frontier cities are all trying to become self sufficient, so a lot of their internal policies resolve around that. Some resources are scarce, and printer time is valuable for specialist applications. Printing printers is very time consuming, especially for larger printers or high-precision printers.

The military has separate printers and some resources are limited to being used by only the military.

The new world is teeming with resources, and the use of U.S. harvesters is floated, but most of the resources from other countries comes from normal trade.

Money
-----

Money is standardized for known galaxy, even corpos use the same currency for simplicity. Each planet in the system has some kind of central banking infrastructure that is updated with information from the main banking network whenever ships arrive to transmit data. We're not making this a barter economy, though that does still exist.

Each nation in the new world has their own currency, and the smaller countries usually have their own internal currency, but use their nearest superpower's currency for trade.


.. _United Systems:

United Systems
--------------

A conglomeration of systems around the galaxy, they are the main power in the civilized area. As the frontier is far outside that, the Corpos try to exert a lot of expansionary power, but so far have been overshadowed by the sheer size of the U.S.

.. _Gra Valkas:

Gra Valkas Empire
-----------------

An almost direct rip from the Japan Summons work, they are an expansionist, highly xenophobic and supremacist nation. More based on a cross between Nazi Germany and the USSR than Imperial Japan in my work, they are the quintessential bad guys.

Wherever they go destruction, enslavement and death follow. Their gray uniforms are feared across the second civilization area's smaller countries after they were transported to the new world almost a decade ago.

Gra Valkas is a huge landmass, almost the size of Russia, and only about half of it is populated. Old power stations utilize coal and oil, their tanks are basically `Tiger II`_ tanks.

Still using mostly bolt-action rifles, they do have automatic weapons including heavy machine guns like the MG34 and submachine guns like the PPSh or MP40.

The Gra Valkans conduct mostly gunboat diplomacy, destroying any enemies they may have in order to take them over and utilize their resources in what they see an efficient way.

They are highly narcissistic, and believe themselves to be better than most of the other countries, so they have very little reason to do anything but conquer in their mind.

.. _Mu:

The Empire of Mu
----------------

One of the worlds main superpowers, they control a large chunk of the main western continent. They are basically an inter-war society, and due to their transported nature they mostly rely on technology instead of magic, in contrast to the :ref:`Mirishial Empire`.

Also prone to gunboat diplomacy, this is only because of the other powers around them. Usually content utilizing actual diplomatic means to get their way instead of force, they are somewhat expansionist, but understand the pitfalls of simply destroying the population of any colonial group.

Similar to an interwar Western European power, they have diplomats in all the major nations in the 'Civilized Areas.'

.. _Mirishial Empire:

Mirishial Empire
----------------

A purely magical empire, they are also somewhat interwar in their level of tech. On the edge of having analogues to jet fighters, they see the value of their military, but focus a lot on ancient artifacts from the :ref:`Ravernal Empire` and use that magic technology to shoot a bit ahead of the :ref:`Mu`.

Massive ships make them feel very safe in general, and being regarded as the strongest power definitely helps after their victories in previous wars against their neighbor on the island to the east.

.. _Parpaldia:

Parpaldian Republic
-------------------

In *Japan Summons* they are basically a 1700's force, which is kind of dumb. I'm going to make them into a republic on the eastern continent, with a very militant philosophy, but too much pride to make it really work.

They have a massive population, and are willing to literally use them to advance. The first to discover gunpowder, they use that instead of magic crystals for their weapons like the Mu, but also incorporate magic spells in much of their work. Basically a Hybrid of :ref:`Mu` and the :ref:`Mirishial Empire` in every way, they are relatively oppressive to their subjects. Still nothing like what the :ref:`Gra Valkas` does, they are by no means nice. The entire continent is considered part of the Parpaldian Republic.

Their tactics are usually more swarm-like, even in their diplomacy. Known to bring over a hundred diplomats to meetings, they try to overwhelm their opponents with voices, since they consider each state in the republic to be a separate 'country,' though no other superpowers do.

.. _Uncivilized World:

The Uncivilized World
---------------------

Most of them significantly behind in terms of development, they usually do trade with the rest of the world, including Parpaldia, Mu and the Mirishials. They are definitely looked down upon by the three main powers, but their resources are indispensible and many of the uncivilized countries are left alone only because of their remote locations.

To the west of :ref:`Mu` they have mostly all been taken over by the :ref:`Gra Valkas`.








.. _Ravernal Empire:

Ravernal Empire (dead)
----------------------

An ancient empire that engulfed the world in flames centuries ago. Still remembered in histories, they were part of the central continent that the :ref:`Mirishial Empire` currently occupies.

Futuristic in their technology, we don't really know what they actually had or were limited by.
