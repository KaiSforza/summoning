## Research Team Protocols

1. Research Priority - anything but research takes a back seat
2. Non-Interference - Native species should not be interfered with.
3. Defense - The base borders are the base borders. Defend them at all costs.
4. Protection - sufficiently advanced civilizations should be protected.
5. Aid - Render aid to fellow research groups.
