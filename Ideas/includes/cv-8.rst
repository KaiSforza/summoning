   * - Powertrain
     - Multiple powertrain options exist, depending on the use case. In normal fighting, they usually have a supply chain and are used as normal IFVs. For the frontier they are used as *very* heavy long-distance, all-terrain research vessels, and require a different power setup. It's got a small fusion drive in the frontier that takes up two extra seats and can recharge the power cells for months::

        Normal: Self-contained power system, endurance for ~2000 km
        Frontier: Endurance for months with reduced crew and ammo capacity
                  All-terrain option for crossing water
                  (hover and sub, depending on depth)
   * - Crew
     - ::

        Normal: 3 + 8
        Frontier: 3 + 6
                  Usually only 2+4 due to experiments and lack of combat
