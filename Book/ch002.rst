Everyone had come out to see what was happening. Even the early drinkers in the tavern had taken their cups out to find out what was going on. A smattering of clouds made it difficult to truly ascertain anything high in the sky.

"Is it Mu finally coming with their metal dragons?"

"No, this doesn't sound like them. I go there on the ship and they sound completely different from this. It's got to be the Mirishial's magic jet fliers."

"No, this definitely sounds like a Mu metal dragon."

From the clouds descended a single mechanical fighter, approaching at a very steep angle. It was unlike anything the villagers had seen in Mu, with a single set of wings and a metal and glass cockpit. Lacking the upper wings of the Mu biplanes, it was definitely not something from their friend and ally.

Suddenly, dozens of them broke through the cloud layer, all flying directly towards the coastal village.

"This isn't Mu! They must be attacking!"

Panic spread through the small crowd, and rightly so, as the lead fighter let fly some of his ordinance. The 20mm cannon rounds arced into one of the houses, blasting the wood beams supporting it to splinters and spreading roofing material over a wide swath.

Most of the people ran away from the destroyed house, but some were injured and others simply lay there, unmoving. On the beach, large gray metal ships sped up onto the shore, lowering the frontal ramp and letting out a contingent of troops and metal land dragons.

A few of the people had been armed, a normal thing for the wilds of Vauxnia, but they stood no chance against the automatic fire directed at them.

"I told you, this place is basically uninhabited. Mu trades with them for their small oil reserves, but this will be a perfect staging area to surround them." Savlik's dark, beady eyes glistened as he listened to the radio reports from the pilots.

Rear Admiral Hannaz agreed. "We'll have to get the construction ships working overtime, there isn't any infrastructure here to work with."
