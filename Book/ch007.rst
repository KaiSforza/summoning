Central Calendar, Day 14 Month 1 1640, Transit to Mu
----------------------------------------------------

The battle at Vauxnia had been beneficial in many ways, especially from an information gathering standpoint. During the battle they had learned about the worlds' weapons and military technology, while the now safe Vauxnians had been more than happy to talk at length about their allies, the Mu Empire. Until recently regarded as the second strongest power on their planet, they appeared to have been eclipsed by the newly powerful Gra Valkan Empire.

Finley Price was on his way in a specially outfitted diplomatic SX-23. Wary of the normality that the Vauxnians spoke of their war mongering neighbors, a fully equipped squad of U.S.F.D.F. soldiers was ready, though would not leave the vehicle unless needed. Based on the exploration model instead of the military support craft, it had sensors for everything, as well as sustainment for long duration missions. With a secured communication system on board as well, it was perfect as almost a mobile embassy. What could easily be mistaken as an office was on the starboard side, across from the mini barracks for the soldiers. The other diplomats on the flight were once again excited. After the discovery of almost historical references to Gra Valkan armament, everyone had been discussing what type of country Mu would be. Would it also map onto an ancient Earth civilization or would it be its own beast?

"The anticipation is killing me. I wonder if they'll respond to the radio signals we are sending out." Finley's subordinates had all become antsy and had bets going for what kind of civilization Mu would be.

"I'm heading up to the bridge to check in with the pilots."

Mu Military Base near Otaheit
-----------------------------

"Sir, I'm picking something up on the radio, but it makes no sense. We have no reports of anything in that direction, and what it's saying makes less sense."

"Play it on the speakers."

Finley's voice carried throughout the signals department.

*"Greetings, Mu. My name is Finley Price, diplomat for the United Systems Frontier on Omuen 6. We have previously made contact with an island, Vauxnia, and have learned about your country. We would like to begin diplomatic proceedings with the Empire of Mu on good terms. Please respond if we are cleared to land at one of your airports or heliports."*

"They have been sending on this frequency for the past 15 minutes. We've figured it's not something from the Gra Valkans. What do we do with something like this, sir?"

The head of the signals section on the base was just as confused as his subordinates. If this was a diplomatic mission then he would have to get the Foreign Affairs Bureau. While the signals department verified and analyzed the radio message, they would let the Bureau decide what they should actually end up doing.

"Send the message to the Foreign Affairs Bureau. They'll want to hear this. For now, let's triangulate and figure out where they are sending this from."

Otaheit, Foreign Affairs Bureau
-------------------------------

"Yes, we'll figure it out right away. This might be another new country..." Marian was speaking with the Emperor on the urgent wire line. Only to be used in dire situations, this felt like one. Who the hell even were the "United Systems Frontier?" No one had ever even head of something like that. Sure, smaller nations had united in the past, but that hadn't happened for almost a decade near Mu.

Reading through the transcript the signals department had sent over, he was a bit perplexed. They had no reason to stop them from coming, technically, but the nature of their message and the way it was worded seemed almost too polite. Maybe the meeting with the Gra Valkans earlier in the month had ruined his diplomatic senses.

It was up to him, though. They were requesting an airport or "heliport," another curiosity. Whatever that was, they could offer up a civilian airport near Otaheit. If they had a plane, they must have traded with the Mirishials or Parpaldians, and they must be from a nearby island, but the name sounded nothing like a name from the islands. It may not be a good idea to let them land at a civilian airport, just in case.

*Shit, we should also be sending out an escort. Ah, I'll let the military deal with that.*

"Oiranne, tell the signals guys to reply. Send them to the military base near Otaheit, Fort Duchamp. Oh, and make sure they send planes to escort them. I'm sure they'll think of that themselves." Orianne nodded and left to her own office to make the calls.

*Let's see who this 'United Systems Frontier' is.*

Fifteen minutes later, Marian entered a car to the military base.

Airspace East of Otaheit
------------------------

The Mu fighters they sent were brand new models, impressive new single-wing fighters that they thought could challenge the Gra Valkans in air combat.

After the base had radioed to the United Systems Frontier ship landing coordinates, they had received their approach vector. Notified of the escort fighters, the U.S.F. was unperturbed and simply asked for their cruising speed. Conservative numbers were relayed to not give away specifications on their newly designed aircraft.

Approaching the vector with his wingman, Victor was expecting to see a biplane, maybe even an old transport plane floating through the sky at a stately pace.

He was, to put it mildly, surprised. The--well, it wasn't really an aircraft. It didn't have a propeller or wings or anything that, to Victor, made it a plane.

*What keeps you up? Is this some magic Mirishial stuff?*

Victor and his wingman went on either side of the craft, flying with it all the way to the base. When it landed, it simply slowed to a near halt and came down softly on the runway, the sides of the ship rotating 90 degrees independently while feet came out from below.

---

It touched down so softly that Marian was still waiting for it to finish landing. The sheer power of it had almost blown his hat off, and when the platform descended from the center of the ship, he almost lost his hat. The smooth, almost fuzzy appearance of the craft was identical to the pictures they had of the suspected Gra Valkan craft they had pictures of. Seeing it in person he realized that it must have been much higher than they thought. This ship was massive, dwarfing even the massive bombers that Mu had begun developing only recently. It almost seemed more a sky ship than a plane.

A single man walked off the platform, waving a greeting towards Marian.

"Hello!" he shouted, trying and somehow succeeding at overcoming the engines as they spun down. Marian timidly returned the wave. As the man he assumed to be Finley Price walked over, Finley reached out his hand to shake with his.







.. During the skirmish with the Gra Valkans and in the investigation that followed, the United Systems Frontier had gained an understanding of the Empire. From history data sources, they had matched a surprising number of their weapons and codes to ancient Earth technology.
