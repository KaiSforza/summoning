Day 1, Month 2, 1640, United Systems Embassy in Vauxnia
-------------------------------------------------------

All of the U.S.F. employees in the embassy were moving around like mice. After almost a month of preparation, development and planning, the main construction on the island of Vauxnia had been completed: the military base was fully functioning and supply ships were flying back and forth on regular schedules with hydroponic produce.

But one thing was missing. Until recently, the U.S.F. was simply listening for radio messages. They would send them out if prompted, but it was only ever local radio coverage. After understanding the technology limitations that they would have to stay within reason of, the U.S.F. had designed a series of small satellites to send into orbit. While not a full constellation yet, A rotation of spacecraft were stationed in the space above both the U.S.F. base and Vauxnia. This gave quality reconnaissance over the main areas the U.S.F. had control over, as well as communications between the zones. With the ship above Vauxnia, it could send radio signals all the way to the Mu continent, potentially opening up a line of communication with the people Vauxnia traded with in the past.

Right after lunch, almost all of the diplomats were gathered outside Finley Price's door. Inside, they were preparing to send the message that would make contact with the second strongest empire on the planet.

*"Greetings, Empire of Mu. This is the United Systems Frontier base formerly in the Omuen system. We are reaching out to contact you as we have no knowledge of aggressive military action that Mu has taken recently. Currently we are based on the island of Vauxnia to your north. We would like to request a meeting to discuss opening diplomatic ties with you. After some problems that we encountered in Vauxnia with the Gra Valkan Empire, we feel that there is a mutual interest here."*

Following were a series of instructions to help the Mu reply and send a diplomatic ship or plane. Everything was repeated so that they should be able to get a full message at some point. The drone that contained the message was sent out and would circle over the Mu capital slowly to transmit, and the replies would be routed and sent to Finley and his team.

The doors finally opened and Finley saw his subordinates outside, waiting, barely anyone even breathing.

"We've sent the drone and finalized the message. Now the ball is in Mu's court."

Mu Foreign Affairs Bureau
-------------------------

"Sir, the military has sent us a message. They've found a plane sending a radio message on one of our common shipping frequencies." A yellow signals department memo was placed in front of Marian. The signals analysis team had transcribed and notated message, along with a detail of the signal strength, approximate location and movement. "It looks like they want a reply, they even sent the frequency and type of signal they will be looking for. What do we do?"

Marian read through the message. A few years ago something similar had happened with the Gra Valkas Empire. Instead of radio messages, they had sent envoys on warships to intimidate or simply level other small countries. They had come out of nowhere, just like this "United Systems Frontier" seemed to. Their location far to the north in the small islands of Vauxnia suggested that they had probably borrowed a plane and a radio from the magical Mirishials but didn't have the technology to make their own.

Almost none of the non-superpowers had aircraft, and the height that the radio operators were saying this message came from was out of reach of any dragon or wyvern.

"How long has signals been listening and tracking this?"

"For over an hour, sir. It's just been circling far overhead the whole time."

"We'd better send open up a channel or they'll run out of fuel and go home."

Nothing about the message seemed aggressive, but Marian ordered a pair of Mu's newest fighters to go and check out whatever was sending these signals.

Airspace Over Mu
----------------

Following direction from the ground control station was trivial, and the two pilots made contact with the radio signal source, or at least where it was supposed to be.

*There's nothing here...*

Out of the corner of his eye he spotted it. The drone was no bigger than a pigeon, it's wings elongated and designed for maximum endurance with very low power. It was slow, lazily and confidently tracing a circle over the capitol.

"HQ, the transmitter appears to be about the size of a bird. Not sure if there are any people on board, but it doesn't look harmful. It's going slow, so if anything happens we can shoot it. Not sure how it's emitting a radio signal, at that size."

*"Roger. Wait, what did you say?"*

Back at the Foreign Affairs Bureau Marian was busy trying to figure out what the handheld cameras of the copilots had captured. It was for sure a plane, but it had that fuzziness that the pictures from their negotiation with Gra Valkas showed.
