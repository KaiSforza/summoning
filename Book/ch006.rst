Central Calendar, Day 3 Month 1 1640, Otaheit, Mu
-------------------------------------------------

The foreign affairs bureau was bustling with activity. Recently, the newly appeared Gra Valkas Empire had sent an envoy to Mu regarding one of their lost fleets. Apparently they had lost track of it. How someone loses an entire fleet, now that's a mystery.

"Sir, we've received a transmission from the Gra Valkan diplomat. They should be arriving in port soon."

Were they planning to blame Mu for this? The Gra Valkan ships, while not completely out-classing the Mu navy, definitely had stronger armament and armor than the smaller ships of Mu. Less agile, they had shown that their air power could easily close the gap even if Mu's ships were faster. With barely disguised contempt, the Gra Valkans stayed out of Mu waters and territory, but the day was only drawing nearer when these two nations would come to blows.

Diplomatic Flotilla, South of Mu
--------------------------------

Oskar was sitting in the nerve center of the flagship *Adroit*. The ship that had single-handedly leveled the island nation of Paganda was now known across what the natives called the civilized world. Not that it actually was civilized, they just didn't know any better. After visits to countless small countries and 'superpowers,' Oskar had come to the conclusion that these people knew neither civilization nor power.

The hustle and bustle in the bridge was almost oppressive, everyone preparing to meet Mu's foreign affairs ministry. As they into the docks, the civilians all stopped what they were doing. Some quickly hid while others stood, mouths open at the might of the Gra Valkan Navy. While these 'civilized' people had heard of the ship, none had seen it in person. *Adroit* dwarfed the military ships of Mu, even the largest Mu vessel seemed a toy in comparison.

Usually shown as a peaceful country, Mu definitely had something to do with the loss of the Northern Subjugation Fleet. With Oskar's hand-picked team, he would get to the bottom of this. While somewhat risky, they all knew that the *Adroit* sitting in the harbor would stop Mu from trying anything stupid, and based on previous meetings, they had been almost too forthright and honest.

From here Oskar felt invincible. With the direct order to start a war with Mu if they had anything to do with the destruction of the Northern Subjugation Fleet, he felt like he had all the cards.

As the gangway was secured and their path to potential enemy territory opened up, Oskar couldn't help but get a little spring in his step.

Foreign Affairs Bureau, Mu
--------------------------

"The diplomats from the Gra Valkan Empire are here." The aide had seen the ship from the windows and was barely keeping her composure in check.

"Alright, send them in. No reason to keep them waiting." Marian sipped the perfectly made coffee one last time and gathered up the papers in front of him. In front of him were reports and details from the island nation of Vauxnia. To him it was all insanity, but it was the only thing showing that Mu was not involved.

As the door opened, Marian and his aides were greeted with a terrible smile. Oskar walked in, opening his arms wide, "My Mu counterparts! Let's figure out some solution to this 'misunderstanding.'" The laugh that came later caused the hairs on the back of Marian's neck to rise.

The aide at the door showed the Gra Valkan party to their seats around the large, circular table. The gray suits of the Gra Valkans were imposing, the same color and feel as their soldiers uniforms with sharp, dangerous lines.

Once seated, all of the Gra Valkans besides Oskar were busy organizing papers from their briefcases.

"My name is Oskar Glas, assistant to the head of the Gra Valkan Empire Foreign Affairs Department. We are here to get to the bottom of the issues we've run into up north, with our Northern Subjugation Fleet."

The aide besides Oskar pulled out a map which he laid on the easel between the two groups.

"As you can see, this was the map given to us by Mu, showing your territorial holdings, client states, and allies. So far, our Glorious Emperor has extended his unending mercy by not beginning a war with Mu." Oskar walked over as he spoke, pulling out an extendable pointer with a bright red tip. "Over...here," he pointed to the small cluster of islands well to the north of Mu, "we have lost a fleet. Now, the island is not part of Mu, nor is it a protectorate, so why would you decide to meddle in our affairs and attack our fleet?"

All of the Mu diplomats looked on with stony faces, no one reveal anything to this man or his aides.

"We have no record nor information about your fleet." Another map was placed on the board, "as you all can see, our fleets are busy in the south with training, and the ones up north are never far from our shores. Why we would be so far from our home makes no sense. We have seen your movements recently, and have found no reason to stop them or object through international law." *Not that they respect it themselves,* thought Marian.

"All of the countries besides yours on and around this continent have been made into imperial holdings of the Gra Valkas Empire, and there is no way any other navy nearby could even come close to "
