Central Calendar, Day 3 Month 1 1640, Otaheit, Mu
-------------------------------------------------

The foreign affairs bureau was bustling with activity. Recently, the newly appeared Gra Valkas Empire had sent an envoy to Mu regarding one of their lost fleets. Apparently they had lost track of it. How someone loses an entire fleet, now that's a mystery.

"Sir, we've received a transmission from the Gra Valkan diplomat. They should be arriving in port soon."

Were they planning to blame Mu for this? The Gra Valkan ships, while not completely out-classing the Mu navy, definitely had stronger armament and armor than the smaller ships of Mu. Less agile, they had shown that their air power could easily close the gap even if Mu's ships were faster. With barely disguised contempt, the Gra Valkans stayed out of Mu waters and territory, but the day was only drawing nearer when these two nations would come to blows.

Diplomatic Flotilla, South of Mu
--------------------------------

Oskar was sitting in the nerve center of the flagship *Adroit*. The ship that had leveled the island nation of Paganda was now known across what the natives called the civilized world. Not that it actually was civilized, they just didn't know any better. After visits to countless small countries and 'superpowers,' Oskar had come to the conclusion that these people knew neither civilization nor power.
