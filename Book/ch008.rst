Marian hated flying. He was old enough to have seen the early commercial airliners, and they had been absolute death traps. Dozens of flights had crashed with myriad fatal problems. Since air safety had improved over the last decade those were events almost totally relegated to the past, but anyone who remembered could still be found taking the much slower but safer trains and boats to their destinations. Sadly, time dictated that a plane be used, and Marian was currently acquainting himself with the lavatory.

The knocks told Marian that the person outside was growing more and more impatient. He'd been here for some time, and with such little time before landing, he was tempted to force the knocker to wait.

*Just hold it.*

Another dry heave hit.

*You'll thank me later. This place smells like a pandemic.*

The knocking grew louder, even more insistent.

*Fine, I'll get out. Maybe I can use one of those bags and make the whole plane miserable.*

Outside was his assistant, Roland Hebras. Lean, with a full head of curly brown hair, he was too young to be worried about flying like this. "Sir, we're almost at the island. Some of the other diplomats have been pulling out binoculars and have catching glimpses of the island. They're...confused."

"Well, get me a pair. I think I can hold steady enough to look out a window."
