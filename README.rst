Summoning Frontier
==================

In the future, frontier outposts are scattered across the systems in our galaxy. The comfortable human settlements close to the Sol System are completely different from the frontier bases over 100 light years away. Inhospitable worlds, dangerous flora and fauna, and resource scarcity that means they sometimes still rely on the central systems to continue functioning.

The Omuen system lies over 140 light years away from civilized space, and Omuen 6 is the most habitable planet in the system. This doesn't mean much, as the high temperatures on the surface barely get over -40C, with winds that can literally pick a person up. Pre-settlement scouting had confirmed tectonic movement and an earth-like planet under the ice, so the terraforming stations were erected. Someday generations in the future this ball of ice will be habitable.

After a terrible ice storm that locked the frontier base in their underground home, the world looked drastically different. Follow their exploration of the New World, inhabited by humans and beasts both familiar and unfamiliar, and seemingly a nexus for transported nations across space and time.

  This map will be updated with something more resembling the world I'm thinking
  of, not the 'default' Summoning Japan world.
